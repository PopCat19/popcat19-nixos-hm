# This function has been moved to nixos-workflows.fish
# Use nixos-edit-rebuild from that file instead
#
# The new implementation provides:
# - Better error handling
# - Consistent argument parsing
# - Integration with the new core utilities
# - Help system integration
#
# Usage remains the same:
#   nixos-edit-rebuild [options]
#   nixos-edit-rebuild --help
